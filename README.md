Terraform AWS Auto Scaling Infrastructure
Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Terraform to design and manage AWS infrastructure as code.
The goal of the project is to create a scalable and reliable EC2 setup using Auto Scaling and core AWS networking components.

Project Objective:
To manage AWS infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
To create a scalable EC2 environment using Auto Scaling
To apply AWS networking and security best practices

Tools & Technologies Used:
Terraform – Infrastructure as Code
AWS EC2 – Compute service
AWS Auto Scaling – Automatic instance scaling
AWS VPC – Network isolation and security

Why These Tools Were Used:
Terraform helps define cloud infrastructure using code, making it reusable and consistent
AWS EC2 provides flexible compute resources
Auto Scaling automatically adjusts EC2 instances based on demand
VPC ensures secure and isolated networking
